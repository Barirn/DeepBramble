			AZOLLA: Here is what we currently know of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye of the Universe</color>]]>. Some time ago, our clan detected a signal older than the universe.

			SENNETTI: Escall immediately had our clan warp to the approximate location of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>, but something went wrong. Rather than arriving at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>, we arrived in the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>, which quickly ensnared and compromised our <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>.

			NESIA: While escape pods 1, 2, and 3 were able to launch, our pods were compromised, stranding us. We attempted to construct a makeshift warp device, but it only served to send us deeper into the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>, where we have been trapped ever since.

			OKALIS: While we are continuing our search for a means of escape, this set of circumstances has rendered us currently unable to reunite with our clan and continue the search for the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>. Unfortunately, we have become unable to detect the signal previously encountered, likely due to our compromising position.
