			NESIA: Okay, after leaving the area through the opening we found near the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Planetoid Cluster</color>]]>, we seem to have emerged into another large, open space. Okalis, can you verify that the signals of our friends can be found within the node we just left?

			OKALIS: Give me a momentâ€¦ Yes, I can detect their signals coming from this knot that we emerged from.

			NESIA: Interesting, do you suppose that we have arrived in the same area that we previously left?

			OKALIS: I suppose so. To be honest, while the idea that we emerged into the same area that we left confuses me, I also find it quite exciting!

			NESIA: This may also explain the curious signal I'm detecting coming from this node. If it truly is recursive, then this signal may simply be the ambience of this chamber, amplified through multiple passings through this node!

			OKALIS: I propose that we inform the others of this immediately. A recursive node/dimension pair is certainly an important scientific discovery!
