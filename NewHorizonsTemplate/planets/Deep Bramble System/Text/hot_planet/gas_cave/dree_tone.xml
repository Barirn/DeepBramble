			SENNETTI: With the analysis of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>’s signal consuming most of our time, travel has become a significant time sink. Due to this, I have brought my side research here, so that I can continue work on it during downtime in the study of the signal.

			SENNETTI: I have decided to conduct more research into the alien’s physiology. In particular, I wish to perform further analysis on the high-pitched tones that they use for echolocation. I have brought a recording of those tones here. Feel free to study it yourself as well, you know I always welcome your insight.
