This is just a doc containing the text that the tools at https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/guides/translation/ won't catch for
translations. It follows the format "text": description, where text is the English version of the text in the mod and
description is a short description of the context for that text. They are also separated into the sections of the
translation doc that they should be in.

I think this is fairly exhaustive, but if you happen to notice any texts that the tool doesn't catch and aren't listed here
please make an issue in the GitHub repo!
