    <Text>
      ANALYTICNOMAI: Unfortunately, it appears that our gamble has not quite payed off how we wanted. It would seem that we are still trapped within this strange place.

    <Text>
      SPOOKEDNOMAI: What are we going to do? We have neither the means to return to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]>, nor a source of oxygen. If we do not act quickly, this will almost 
    certainly be our final resting place!

      ANALYTICNOMAI: If you squint through the fog, there appear to be holes in the walls that surround us. As much as it pains me to say, we may need to split up in search of oxygen.

    <Text>
      NOMAILEADER: I see six holes in the walls, we will each select one and attempt to locate a reliable source of oxygen on the other side. Once one is found, return here and wait to lead the others to it. With any luck, this plan will see us all through this endeavor alive.

      ANALYTICNOMAI: Visibility in this place is far from optimal, so I will leave a signal beacon here to ensure that we can find our way back. If luck is on our side, it may also lead other Nomai to our 
      current location.
