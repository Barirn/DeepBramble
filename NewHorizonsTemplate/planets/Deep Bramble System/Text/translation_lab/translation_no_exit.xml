			OKALIS: I am sorry to report my investigations have not uncovered an escape. I have scoured <![CDATA[<color=orange>Briar’s Hollow</color>]]>, but have been thoroughly unable to find any new passageways.

			AZOLLA: This is troubling news. If we are unable to locate an exit, we will not be capable of reuniting with the rest of our clan or locating the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye of the Universe</color>]]>. We should all continue searching for an exit. I refuse to believe we are entirely ensnared by the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>.

		<Text>
			SENNETTI: I find that to be very unlikely. The Dree have been here for thousands of years, the idea they would overlook an exit for that long is improbable.
