			NESIA: Sennetti, anybody who may have survived the crash has certainly made the reasonable assumption that we all perished as well. As such, they will certainly be unwilling to return to the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>. We are on our own.

			NESIA: Stop it Azolla! We have been in the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Deep Bramble</color>]]> for months now! At this point, the rest of our clan has certainly concluded that, if we had survived, we would have found a way out of the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>. Nobody is coming for us, and the idea that we can locate an exit the others have neglected for thousands of years is completely nonsensical!
