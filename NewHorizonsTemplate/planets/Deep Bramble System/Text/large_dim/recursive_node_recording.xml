			NESIA: Okay, after leaving the area through the opening we found near <![CDATA[<color=orange>Titan's Tears</color>]]>, we seem to have emerged into another large, open space. Okalis, can you verify the signals of our friends can be found within the node we just left?

			OKALIS: My apologies for the interruption, Nesia, but I am also detecting their signals in that direction.

			OKALIS: I suppose so. How exciting! Even seeing the spatial anomaly from when we first arrived, I never would have expected leaving this area may bring us directly back into it!

			NESIA: Suppose this node is recursive in some way? That would explain the curious signal I am detecting coming from it. If it truly is recursive, then this signal may simply be the ambience of this chamber, amplified through multiple passings through this node!

			OKALIS: I propose we inform the others of this immediately. A recursive node/dimension pair is certainly an important scientific discovery!
