			OKALIS: Hello Amylax! I apologize for not reacting properly to the gift you left in my home in <![CDATA[<color=orange>Graviton’s Folly</color>]]>, I did not understand at the time that it was a courting ritual!

			OKALIS: As for my response, I wholeheartedly accept your offer of partnership! I have left the appropriate necklace in your home, as per the second half of the ritual. I hope that you don’t mind, but I was unable to construct it from the traditional vines, since I lack the talents shared by your people.

			OKALIS: I also sincerely hope that the wall I had to place to write this on is unobstructive. It should be fairly easy to disassemble, which we could even do together if you so wished!
