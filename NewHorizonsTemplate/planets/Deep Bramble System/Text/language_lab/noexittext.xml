			AZOLLA: Sennetti, have you had any luck asking the Dree about how to leave the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Deep Bramble</color>]]>?

		<Text>
			SENNETTI: I have asked many people about how to leave, but so far they’ve all said that escape is impossible.

		<Text>
			OKALIS: I am sorry to report that my investigations have not bore fruit either. I’ve scoured the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Large Dimension</color>]]>, but have been thoroughly unable to find any new passageways.
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>

		<Text>
			AZOLLA: This is troubling news. If we are unable to locate an exit, then I do not like our odds of reuniting with the rest of our clan, or locating the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye of the Universe</color>]]>. Continue searching for an exit, I refuse to believe that we are entirely ensnared by the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>.

			NESIA: That is… troubling. Suppose they simply haven’t found a suitable exit yet?

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>102</ID>
		<ParentID>101</ParentID>
		<Text>
			SENNETTI: I find that to be very unlikely. The Dree have been here for thousands of years, the idea that they would overlook an exit for that long is improbable.
