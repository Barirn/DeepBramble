			OKALIS: I am happy to report our relations with our new friends seem to be going well! In fact, Amylax saw fit to deliver a gift to me!

			SENNETTI: That is good to hear! However, I have to wonderâ€¦ Okalis, may I ask what the nature of this gift is?
		</Text>

			OKALIS: It is a lovely necklace, woven from several small vines which seem to have been made to grow around one another. I am honestly unsure how he must have made it. Perhaps he used the druidic influence his people seem to have? Whatever the case, it must have taken some time to create.

			SENNETTI: Hm, yes, I suspected that might be the case. Okalis, I feel I should inform you that, based on my studies of these alien's culture, a necklace such as that is a key component of the traditional courting ritual. Usually, the intended recipient will either refuse the necklace, indicating a lack of interest, or accept it and gift the initiator with a similar necklace.

			OKALIS: Are you certain? A courting ritual?! That would implyâ€¦ was Amylax asking me to be his partner!?! How do I properly respond to that!?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
			SENNETTI: Well, I would guess by either refusing or accepting the offer. Which one you choose is up to you, though I would strongly suggest you make a decision soon. I suspect that you have left Amylax quite confused.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>

		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<Text>
			OKALIS: Refuse or accept... If that is the case, then Sennetti, would you be willing to help me gain a better understanding of his language? I believe I have a message important enough that it must be written by hand.

			NESIA: That is quite a situation. Okalis, may I ask how you responded to the gift?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<ParentID>101</ParentID>
		<Text>
			OKALIS: How I respond... oh no! I stated I took it as a "surefire token of the continued friendship between ourselves and our species" He extended an offer of partnership and I, for all intents and purposes, called him a very good friend! This is disastrous!
