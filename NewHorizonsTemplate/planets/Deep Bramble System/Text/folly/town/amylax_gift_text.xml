			OKALIS: It is wonderful, Amylax! I fail to recall ever seeing such an intricate necklace, much less one woven from vines! There was no need to come all the way to <![CDATA[<color=orange>Graviton’s Folly</color>]]> to deliver it though. I understand that the inverted gravity is uncomfortable to navigate with your echolocation.
