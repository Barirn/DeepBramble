      <Text>The Nomai noted that the Venomous Reject seems to just be a regular Bramble node that mutated to secrete a toxin, capable of killing other portions of the Bramble. The Nomai also noted that this seems to run in the face of the Bramble's unique nature of growing via propagation.</Text>

      <Text>The Nomai were curious what would happen if a Bramble node was destroyed when it was the only node leading into a given dimension. Some of them theorized that the pocket dimension would collapse entirely, ejecting any objects trapped inside.</Text>
