			NESIA: Unfortunately, analysis of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>â€™s signal is not promising. I am unable to ascertain its location, and am able to derive similarly little information about its purpose. The only trait I am noticing is a high degree of mutability; it seems as if the Eye is something highly capable of change.

			AZOLLA: That is unfortunate. I suppose this information may still prove useful. It is nonetheless discouraging that such an initially promising prospect has proven to be for nought.

			AZOLLA: An update; the signal may yet be of use! We have proposed, and our friends have agreed, that this signal may be the final component required for the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Distant Node Project</color>]]> to carry us to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]>.

			NESIA: Excellent! I will set about collecting a complete recording of the signal as soon as I can. It may take some time due to the noise from the feedback, but it should be achievable.
