			SENNETTI: How do you suppose the signal from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye</color>]]> could be older than the universe?

			NESIA: Perhaps it is by some mechanism entirely outside of our understanding? Maybe it will open some entirely new avenues of research to us.

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>201</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
			OKALIS: Perhaps the Eye originates from somewhere outside of our universe? It almost seems necessary for this to be the case, given how hot and dense the early universe is theorized to have been.

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>202</ID>
		<ParentID>201</ParentID>
		<Text>
			NESIA: This may be a possibility. I do not wish to become overexcited, but suppose it is some manner of spacecraft, constructed by entities from another universe?
		</Text>

	<!--NomaiText.Branch 3-->
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>301</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
			AZOLLA: Grim as it may be, it is possible that some equipment malfunction made it appear older than it truly was. Or perhaps the signal was doctored in some way?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>302</ID>
		<ParentID>301</ParentID>
		<Text>
			SENNETTI: I find it very unlikely that Escall would have warped our clan so quickly if an equipment error was a possibility. If the signal was instead doctored, then perhaps we were lucky to have been ensnared by the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]>!
