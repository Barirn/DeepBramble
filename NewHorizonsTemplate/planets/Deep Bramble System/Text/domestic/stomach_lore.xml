			NESIA: Interesting. It seems that the majority of the anglerfish’s internal volume is taken up by this central cavity, rather than organs.

			OKALIS: But how can that be? They seem to be large predators that have evolved to swallow prey whole. How could they have such a small space for their stomach?

			NESIA: I do not believe that they have any stomach at all. Instead, this interior cavity is normally flooded with a free-floating digestive enzyme, allowing the fish to entrap and consume any organic matter that it can fit inside its mouth.

			NESIA: Additionally, the fact that the enzyme disperses upon petting the eye of the fish is likely not a trained behavior, as it seems unlikely that the Dree would have had any need for such a thing. I believe that, instead, this may allow juvenile fish to brush against the eye of an adult to gain access to their prey.

			AZOLLA: Interesting! It’s rather odd a species that are normally so territorial can become such social creatures once their young are involved.
