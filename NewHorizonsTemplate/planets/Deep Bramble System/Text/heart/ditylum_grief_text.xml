			I don't understand, how could this happen? The recording... did the <![CDATA[<color=purple>Bramble</color>]]> do this? Was it lured in by the heat of the star, thinking that it could feed on it?

			Everyone... I counted them, and everyone's gone. My people, the Nomai, I'm the <![CDATA[<i>]]>only<![CDATA[</i>]]> one that was spared. Even Lioloma, she still has my poem...

			The buildings on <![CDATA[<color=orange>Magma's Recursion</color>]]> were only ruins. Why were they ruins? How long has it been? I thought that I was only gone for a few minutes.
