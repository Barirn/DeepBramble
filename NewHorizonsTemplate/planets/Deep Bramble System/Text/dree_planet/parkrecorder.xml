			SENNETTI: These people certainly seem to enjoy spending their time in this park. I would greatly enjoy deciphering their language, but as it stands I have nowhere to do my work nearby.

			OKALIS: I may have some positive news on that front, friend. The alien that we first made contact with, assuming I am properly understanding their message, is directing us to set up a lab just for that purpose.

			SENNETTI: If that is true, then it is wonderful news! Where are we being permitted to put this lab?

			OKALIS: …That seems to be the catch. We seem to be intended to construct the lab in the knot that is over our heads now, which has no bodies with significant gravity. Additionally, while I have been assured that it is quite harmless, there does seem to be some manner of beast in that area.

			SENNETTI: The lack-of-gravity issue can be quite easily solved using material from <![CDATA[<color=orange>Graviton’s Folly</color>]]>. As for the beast… if it means deciphering the language of these people, then I will be able to power through, regardless of how hideous it may be.
