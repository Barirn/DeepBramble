			AZOLLA: Why do you suppose this area remains so hot? Certainly it should have cooled to some degree after such a long time?

			NESIA: A fair question, one that had occurred to me as well. Currently, my standing hypothesis is that the seeds surrounding the planet lead recursively into this area, based on how they seem to have the same glow.

		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
			OKALIS: An astute observation, but I fail to see how that explains the heat.

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			NESIA: If the planet is surrounded by recursive seeds, it is possible for heat that should leave the area to instead be redirected back inside, maintaining a very high temperature.
