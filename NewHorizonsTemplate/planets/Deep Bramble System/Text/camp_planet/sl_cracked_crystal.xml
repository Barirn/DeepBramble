			SENNETTI: During my most recent trip to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Eye Signal Lab</color>]]> on <![CDATA[<color=orange>Magma's Recursion</color>]]>, I noticed that one of the gravity crystals had fallen from its mount and cracked. Due to the high cost of production for these crystals, it may be worthwhile to develop a means by which they can be repaired. I have brought the crystal here for study.

			NESIA: I would help, but I am currently fully occupied working on the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Distant Node Project</color>]]>. Unfortunately, I suspect this is true for all of us, so it may take some time to develop a means to repair this crystal.

			OKALIS: I have good news! It seems our friends may have found a way to repair the gravity crystal! If you are interested in learning more, I suggest making your way to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Concert Hall</color>]]>.

			SENNETTI: I understand. I hope we have time to develop a method of repairs soon, however, as I worry other crystals may also fall.
