  <!--Asking him about regrets-->
  <DialogueNode>
    <Name>REGRETS</Name>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>I don’t think so. Seeing how it ended, it would be easy to say that we never should have met them, that, if it weren’t for those four, my species might still be alive.</Page>
      <Page>At the same time though, I think they brought out a side of us that we needed. Their curiosity and tenacity rubbed off on us, and I like to think that the best parts of us rubbed off on them. We made each other better, in a lot of ways.</Page>
      <Page>Plus, the alternative to meeting them would be them dying alone, far, far away from home. They wouldn’t have deserved that.</Page>
      <Page>So no, I’m certain that I don’t regret meeting them.</Page>

    <Dialogue>
      <Page>It’s okay. Don’t get me wrong, it still hurts a lot, but I guess we had to go eventually. Just happened to be a bit sooner than you Hearthians.</Page>
      <Page>For what it’s worth, I’m sorry about what happened to your people too.</Page>

    <Dialogue>
      <Page>Heh, afraid not, kinda hard to do that without eyes, y’know?</Page>
      <Page>The Nomai described them a lot though, like billions of deafeningly loud noises, dulled down to gentle whispers by inconceivable distances.</Page>
      <Page>Even if they did ultimately do us in, they sound like they were quite a wonder to behold.</Page>

  <!--Asking why he has so much to say-->

    <Name>WHY_TALKING</Name>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>I’m not sure, honestly. Maybe it has something to do with you not knowing me as much as the others, so there are more blanks to fill in.</Page>
      <Page>Maybe I was the only one technically alive when you entered the Eye, so I came here in a more complete state.</Page>
      <Page>I think it’s fitting though. You stayed and kept me company when I was the last of my people, and now I get to return the favor.</Page>
