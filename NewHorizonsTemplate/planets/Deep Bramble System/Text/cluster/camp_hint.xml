	<TextBlock>
		<ID>1</ID>
		<Text>
			Who is responsible for the campsite on the large planetoid near the center of this area? It represents an excellent location for us to build more permanent residence, and I am quite shocked that someone is keeping it to themselves.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
			AZOLLA: I am inclined to believe our friends, Nesia, and I do not believe that any of our clan would be willing to keep such a secret from the group. Are you certain that the campsite you saw could not have been a natural formation?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
			NESIA: I am absolutely certain. There was a small ring of stones with still smoldering firewood inside.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			AZOLLA: Quite an interesting find, Nesia! We should make our way over there and investigate at once. Do you recall where we can find this planetoid?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
			NESIA: I was concerned that I would be unable to find it again, so I planted a signal beacon near the strange campsite.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
			AZOLLA: Then we should go there at once. If there are other sentient creatures here, it is imperative that we determine their level of hostility as soon as possible.
		</Text>

			SENNETTI: I have been here putting together shelters, I did not realize there were any other bodies out there.

		<Text>
			OKALIS: I have investigated the surrounding area some, but I have not yet located this large planetoid that you speak of.

	<!--NomaiText.Branch 3-->
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>301</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			SENNETTI: Is it possible that the campsite was made by other members of our clan? Perhaps they followed us through our makeshift warp setup and are stranded here as well.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>302</ID>
		<ParentID>301</ParentID>
		<Text>
			NESIA: As much as I would hope for your hypothesis to be true, there were no other structures indicative of Nomai presence, and it has long been outside of our culture to construct campfires.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>


	<!--NomaiText.Branch 4-->
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>401</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			OKALIS: Are you saying that there is a campsite in here that none of us made? That would imply there are other sentient beings here besides us!
		</Text>
