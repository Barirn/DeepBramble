# Forgotten Castaways

*This is a story mod that takes place almost entirely inside of Dark Bramble. Be aware that the description ahead features some spoilers for the base game of Outer Wilds. There are also some small, very early game spoilers for the mod itself.*

Follow the trail of four Nomai who, when their escape pods were rendered inoperable, were forced to retreat farther into the Bramble in search of shelter and resources. Read their logs, rediscover what they found, and uncover the secrets of the Deep Bramble.

This mod is made by people who have already beaten the base game, and is therefore tailored to that experience. However, we have attempted to make it also playable alongside the base game. **If you have an existing save file, I would suggest using that, as the first hint as to where to go will only appear if certain base-game facts are known.**

**This mod does require the DLC for Outer Wilds, Echoes of the Eye.**

## Quality of Life Changes

This mod features a few QOL changes to make navigation inside of Dark Bramble easier.
- ***Drag Removal:*** Normally, DB features a small amount of fluid drag, which slows the player down and caps their speed. For most of the mod, this has been disabled.
- ***Signalscope lock-on:*** Your signalscope has been upgraded to allow you to lock onto things that the signal is attached to, provided that you have both identified the signal and the signal is attached to a lockable body.
- ***Unknown Signal Detection:*** In the base game, unknown signals are not detected while in the ship. This mod allows you to detect unknown signals while piloting your ship.
